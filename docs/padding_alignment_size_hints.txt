Padding, alignment, and size hints
**********************************

The focus of this tutorial is on fine-tuning the size, shape, and position of 
widgets.  The title gives away the three mechanisms for doing this: you can use 
padding to control the amount of space around a widget, alignment to control 
where a widgets goes within the space allocated for it, and size hints to 
control how big a widget is.

In order to explain these concepts in more detail, we need to know a little 
more about how glooey allocates space to widgets.  

In order to explain these concepts in more detail, it will be helpful to 
establish some terminology.

First, each widget is assigned (by it's parent) a rectangle specifying the 
maximum space that widget can occupy.  This is called the "assigned rectangle".  
Each widget also internally keeps track of the minimum amount of space it needs 
for itself and all its children.  This is called the "content rectangle".  




.. Another useful widget that depends on this kind of configuration is Frame.  
   It's purpose is to put borders around other widgets, and to do that it needs 
   both a background widget and a...

.. Wait, customizing the bin is exclusively to control padding, and I hven't 
   talked about that yet.  Maybe I should hold off on this example...
