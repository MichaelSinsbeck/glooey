1. Dialogs: Gonna need the Root widgets to connect to keyboard event as well, 
   and mark all events as handled.  That way events won't propagate between 
   dialogs.

2. Entry: Gonna have the root widgets manage keyboard focus, since otherwise 
   dialogs will mess things up.

3. ViewPort: Let's do it!  This should be a bin, not a miscellaneous widget.

4. Frame: Should have a background image too.  Imagine wanting to make a dialog 
   box.
